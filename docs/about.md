Hi! My name is Kirill and this is my (i can't say blog, it's not that huge)
notebook where I write some notes about what I encounter on the daily basis:
nontrivial tasks, some interesting challenges and just overall exciting
stuff.

While this blog is mostly related to technical stuff, you also can:

- review my code (including this blog and my website) and comment on it's quality on [GitHub](https://github.com/hatedabamboo)
- find my official profile and add me to your network at [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/hatedabamboo)
- watch me shitpot and posting memes on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hatedabamboo) (no, Elon, X is not a valid name for social network)
- take a look at my photos and photos of me at [Instagram](https://instagram.com/hatedabamboo)
