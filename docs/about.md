Hello! I'm Kirill, and this is my humble blog, where I jot down various notes
about my daily experiences: from nontrivial tasks to interesting challenges and
anything else that sparks excitement.

The initial idea originated from my passion for taking notes using
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). However, over time, I realized that some of
my notes could be useful not only to me but also to others. And that's how my
online notebook came to be.

You can find my website [over here](https://hatedabamboo.me) with all the
necessary information and other social links.

## Changelog

I've been thinking for some time that it makes sense to keep track of the
changes I've been making to my blog. So, instead of abandoning them or
creating a separate post for each update (or group of updates), I decided to
add a changelog block here. After all, this page is about the blog, so it
only feels logical.
