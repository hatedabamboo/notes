Hello! I'm Kirill, and this is my not-so-huge notebook (I hesitate to call
it a blog) where I jot down various notes about my daily experiences: from
nontrivial tasks to interesting challenges and anything else that sparks
excitement.

The initial idea originated from my passion for taking notes using
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). However, over time, I realized that some of
my notes could be useful not only to me but also to others. And that's how my
online notebook came to be.

You can find my official website [over here](https://hatedabamboo.me) with
all the necessary information and other social links.
