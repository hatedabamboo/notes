To pass certification or not to pass certification? That is a one complicated question. In this post I will speculate on the topic and share my personal thoughts on certifications as a whole and CKA specifically.

## It's been 84 yearsâ€¦

It's been almost three months since my last post, and all thanks to preparation for CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator) exam. (This was the reason, I assure you, and not the fact that I play videogames every day.)

## CKA: the path to tread

What the preparation consisted of?

I went to the simpliest approach. I googled "cka preparation" and there were a lot of great docs gathered with the same purpose: combine in one place resources that can help you easily prepare for the examination. They all share almost the same resources:

- official kubernetes documentation
- list of topic covered by exam
- videocourse on kubernetes by KodeKloud (created specifically for CKA certification<sup>[[1]](#links)</sup>)

Basically, this is it. This is the amount of theory you will need to dive into the topic from level zero, and I'm not kidding.

The aforementioned videocourse helps to understand the all the concepts of inner kubernetes structure and resources. It's very thorough and well-structured.

The most important part (in my opinion), however, is practice. And practice is what will help to pass the exam in the end. You know, because exam is performance-based after all.

In order to properly prepare for the exam, one must be familiar with terminal and all basic `kubectl` commands. On this field I found very helpful the KLLRCODA playgrounds<sup>[[2]](#links)</sup>. Apart from having scenario-based playgrounds, thay have open free-for-all playground as well, though time limited for free users.

On contrary with Killercoda, KodeKloud (oh gods, why so many Ks in their names) proposes multiple practice labs on each topic. Though tasks are not very complicated, they have predefined environments with erros, so you don't have to do them manually beforehand. Apart from that, KodeKloud course includes several mock exams, which are somewhat similar to actual exam.

But the ultimate killer feature of all resources is killer.sh mock exams which come included with CKA exam purchase (add: from same guys as kllrcoda). These preparations exams don't fuck around: their mock tasks are complicated, timed and very thoughtfully prepared. If you wish to pass the actual exam as a piece of cake, killer.sh mocks are the best way to get the knack of.

(add links to all)

Summing up, a few weeks of theory, a week of intense excercises with practice tasks, labs or exams, and you're good to go.

## Certifications: to do or not to do

The very different questions is the necessity of the certifications itself.

I would disect this topic from two perspectives: your employer covers the cost of certification and you have to pay for in from your pocket.

### Scenario one: your employer pays for certification

This is rather easy question in my opinion. If you don't have to pay 100-400 bucks for the virtual badge, the knowledge and skills that come with it are super handy. Given that you have some spare time in the upcoming 2 months (1-2 hrs a day).

### Scenario two: you pay for the stuff yourself

This is where the fun begins. As the final decision if left for the person itself, I will share my thoughts on this topic.

Certifications as a way of confirming one's knowledge of the topic are useless. They do not confirm that person is actually proficient within the field. For what I know the person could master himslef only to pass certification, but actual skills or knowledge of tasks are nonexistent.

On the other hand, certifications as a thing in IT industry created according learning tools and resources. They contain very nicely refined, concentrated material of theoretical, and sometimes practical, aspect of the topic. So these courses become an incredible tool to dive into the matter, should one have such necessity. I, for one, managed to get aquainted with basic elements of AWS infrastructure thanks to one of those courses in just 3 months. It is an amazing lift in professional field.

So, if you want to get into some specific topic or tool, you can search for courses on the matter. Free or paid, it's up to you, but I have a feeling that paying for stuff makes you more interested in this investment. And a good sidenote: courses also happen to go on sale (yep, just like games on Steam). As for certificates, I'd say there's no particular need to achieve them: they only show that you're organized enough to pass an exam and that you have some spare money.

It has to be mentioned specifically, that in some scenarios obtaining a certificate may be necessary in order to get a new job. In that case, the question to get that certificate is not even a question. It's a very solid and direct investment into one's future: go for it.
